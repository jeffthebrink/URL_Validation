# URL_Validation
URL Validation code challenge for Emma.

Intro:
Hello from sunny Colorado! I spent a lot of my day yesterday learning as much Python as I could in order to complete this code
challenge. I made sure that I did not spend more than 3 hours actually writing it like the instructions listed. I believe I 
ended up spending an hour or less on it.

Instructions to Run:
Copy and paste the UrlValidation.py file code into your favorite IDE running a Python 2.x interpreter. This will not run on
an interpreter that is 3.0 or higher due to the httplib module imported. This module was replaced in Python 3 with
http.client (https://docs.python.org/2/library/httplib.html?highlight=httpsconnection#httplib.HTTPSConnection). I stuck with
Python 2 because that's what my IDE (PyCharm) defaulted to. I have read that Python 2 has slightly better library support and
I'm guessing that's why this occurred (https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3).

Note:
HTTPS support is only available if the socket module was compiled with SSL support. This does mean that some https sites will
not validate as good, giving false failures. If I could spend more time on this project, I would fix that issue. Seth had 
mentioned "not over-thinking" this problem, so I didn't dive any deeper into it.

Thanks for your time and consideration!!!
